Testing Drawbacks:

- Requires that we write more code
- Requries additional tooling and dependencies
- you have to fix old tests if they stop passing (also a pro)

Types of testing:

- Unit testing, or testing small pieces of code like utility functions
- Integration testing, or how different functions work together as a whole.
- End-to-end testing, how the system works together as a whole and with other 3rd-party services
- Snapshot testing
